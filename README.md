# User Directory System

The **User Directory System** is a web application designed to streamline the management of user details. Built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring JPA**, **React**, **MySQL**, and **Bootstrap**, this application allows administrators to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data, providing an intuitive and responsive interface for managing users.

## Features

- **Add Users**: Administrators can add new users and their details to the system.
- **View Users**: Displays a list of all users with their information in a user-friendly interface.
- **Edit User Details**: Administrators can update user information.
- **Delete Users**: Allows for the removal of user records securely and efficiently.

## Tech Stack

### Backend:
- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework used to build stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies backend development by offering built-in support for things like security, configuration, and deployment.
  
- **Spring JPA**: Provides a powerful, easy-to-use abstraction layer for interacting with databases. It simplifies database operations by using Java Persistence API (JPA) and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), allowing you to perform CRUD operations with minimal effort.
  
- **MySQL**: A widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) to store user data in a structured format. It is used here to persist user information and support SQL-based operations.

### Frontend:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for creating interactive UIs by efficiently updating and rendering components as data changes.
  
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework that helps in designing responsive, mobile-first web pages. Bootstrap was used to quickly build the user interface with a clean, modern design. It simplifies layout and component styling, making the app responsive across various screen sizes.
